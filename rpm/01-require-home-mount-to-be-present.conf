# This file amends the unbound systemd settings by making unbound to "follow"
# home mount status. RequiresMountsFor is the same as adding Requires and After
# for home.mount and ensures that unbound is not started until home is mounted.
# PartOf ensures that unbound is stopped before home is unmounted. This is
# because if the configurations go missing when unbound is running undefined
# behavior can happen.

[Unit]
RequiresMountsFor=/home
PartOf=home.mount
